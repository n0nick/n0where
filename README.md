# n0where, circa 2003

This repository includes all of the code for n0where, my intended open-source
blog engine, which I wrote around 2003 and used for running my very own personal
blog at n0nick.net.

I removed configuration files (which included DB credentials) and the
admin password declaration PHP files. If anyone is really interested
they can ask me for an example for such files.
I also removed images used in specific posts (in img/items/), since that is not
relevant to the actual n0where codebase.

This is here mainly for archival and nostalgic purposes.

## License

As mentioned in all of the source files, this is licensed under GPLv2.
I guess this is okay for now, so I'm going to leave this as is.

This excludes third-party libraries and plug-ins used here which indicate their
own licenses.
